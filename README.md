# hackupc-travelperk
EventShpere is a project developed by Marc Bel, Hannah Rober and Paula PÃ©rez with the aim to beat the challenge of TravelPerk at HACKUPC 2024.
_"Develop an application that defines travel plans for travellers given they departure and arrival locations, and times."_

## Inspiration
We wanted to learn how apis work, so we just wanted to give it a go!

## What it does
We created a website on which with only writing the country of your destination, several events appear so that you can find the one that fits you the best. Our web provides information about the name of the event, the date and the link to access to more information.

## How we built it
We created a website on which with only writing the country of your destination, several events appear so that you can find the one that fits you the best.

## Challenges we ran into
One of our problems was how to treat with the responses of the APIs requests with javascript that with the help of the mentors we solved it. Also we had problems on hiding to the public the api key, that one mentor advised us to not share it, and we had to cancel the first one we made.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are mostly proud of accomplishing to have a functional webpage without having previous knowledge about it. We also worked really well as a team, helping each others every time we could.

## What we learned
We didn't have any experience in any of the languages we used for programming the website, so we learned the basics of three new programming languages: javascript, html and css. Also, we learned how to process json files in a website. In general we learned how to build our first webpage throughout reading a lot of documentation. Furthermore we learned what was an API and how to use it in our web.

## What's next for EventShpere
We are looking for adding other apis to suggest music and explain fun and random facts about the destination.
